I often begin by asking, what simple intervention can I make in an image that will transform it? I like to work with formal qualities and my favorite interventions are forms of drawing or erasure. When I draw, I rarely use things like pens, pencils, or charcoal. Instead, I draw with a knife, with a thread and needle, or by creating lines and forms through juxtaposition. Erasure sometimes means cutting an element out of an image. But more often I prefer partial erasure: removing a portion of a particular element, drawing over it, or obscuring it from view. I like to use partial erasure to stimulate the viewers' imagination, inviting them to fill in gaps, to draw unexpected connections, or sometimes to see a ghost.\nMy formal training is in academia. In 2006 I finished my PhD in Classics, with a specialty in Greek literature.

I often begin by asking, what simple intervention can I make in an image that will transform it? I like to work with formal qualities and my favorite interventions are forms of drawing or erasure. When I draw, I rarely use pens, pencils, or charcoal. Instead, I draw with a knife, with a thread and needle, or by creating lines and forms through juxtaposition. Erasure sometimes means cutting an element out of an image. But more often I prefer partial erasure: removing a portion of a particular element, drawing over it, or obscuring it from view. I like to use partial erasure to stimulate the viewers' imagination, inviting them to fill in gaps, to draw unexpected connections, or sometimes to see a ghost.\nMy formal training is in academia. In 2006 I finished my PhD in Classics, with a specialty in Greek literature.

I often begin by asking, what simple intervention can I make in an image that will transform it? I like to work with formal qualities and my favorite interventions are forms of drawing or erasure. When I draw, I rarely use pens, pencils, or charcoal. Instead, I draw with a knife, with a thread and needle, or by creating lines and forms through juxtaposition. Erasure sometimes means cutting an element out of an image. But more often I prefer partial erasure: removing a portion of a particular element, drawing over it, or obscuring it from view. I like to use partial erasure to stimulate the viewers' imagination, inviting them to fill in gaps, to draw unexpected connections, or sometimes to see a ghost.\nMy formal training is in academia. In 2006 I finished my PhD in Classics, with a specialty in Greek literature.

  Parameters: {"artist"=>{"name"=>"Nicholas Charles", "artist_statement"=>"I mainly work with found images. I often begin by asking, what simple intervention can I make in an image that will transform it? I like to work with formal qualities and my favorite interventions are forms of drawing or erasure. When I draw, I rarely use pens, pencils, or charcoal. Instead, I draw with a knife, with a thread and needle, or by creating lines and forms through juxtaposition. Erasure sometimes means cutting an element out of an image. But more often I prefer partial erasure: removing a portion of a particular element, drawing over it, or obscuring it from view. I like to use partial erasure to stimulate the viewers' imagination, inviting them to fill in gaps, to draw unexpected connections, or sometimes to see a ghost.\nMy formal training is in academia. In 2006 I finished my PhD in Classics, with a specialty in Greek literature. As an artist, Iâ€™m mostly self-taught but I have taken a few classes at SVA, including figure drawing and a collage workshop. I live in Brooklyn, NY", "image_url"=>"https://i.imgur.com/kHvKSSc.jpg"}, "id"=>"1"}

I often begin by asking, what simple intervention can I make in an image that will transform it? I like to work with formal qualities and my favorite interventions are forms of drawing or erasure. When I draw, I rarely use pens, pencils, or charcoal. Instead, I draw with a knife, with a thread and needle, or by creating lines and forms through juxtaposition. Erasure sometimes means cutting an element out of an image. But more often I prefer partial erasure: removing a portion of a particular element, drawing over it, or obscuring it from view. I like to use partial erasure to stimulate the viewers' imagination, inviting them to fill in gaps, to draw unexpected connections, or sometimes to see a ghost.\nMy formal training is in academia. In 2006 I finished my PhD in Classics, with a specialty in Greek literature.

I often begin by asking, what simple intervention can I make in an image that will transform it? I like to work with formal qualities and my favorite interventions are forms of drawing or erasure. When I draw, I rarely use pens, pencils, or charcoal. Instead, I draw with a knife, with a thread and needle, or by creating lines and forms through juxtaposition. Erasure sometimes means cutting an element out of an image. But more often I prefer partial erasure: removing a portion of a particular element, drawing over it, or obscuring it from view. I like to use partial erasure to stimulate the viewers' imagination, inviting them to fill in gaps, to draw unexpected connections, or sometimes to see a ghost.\nMy formal training is in academia. In 2006 I finished my PhD in Classics, with a specialty in Greek literature. As an artist, Iâ€™m mostly self-taught but I have taken a few classes at SVA, including figure drawing and a collage workshop. I live in Brooklyn."], ["updated_at", "2021-08-18 01:04:32.479183"], ["id", 1]]

I often begin by asking, what simple intervention can I make in an image that will transform it? I like to work with formal qualities and my favorite interventions are forms of drawing or erasure. When I draw, I rarely use pens, pencils, or charcoal. Instead, I draw with a knife, with a thread and needle, or by creating lines and forms through juxtaposition. Erasure sometimes means cutting an element out of an image. But more often I prefer partial erasure: removing a portion of a particular element, drawing over it, or obscuring it from view. I like to use partial erasure to stimulate the viewers' imagination, inviting them to fill in gaps, to draw unexpected connections, or sometimes to see a ghost.\nMy formal training is in academia. In 2006 I finished my PhD in Classics, with a specialty in Greek literature.
