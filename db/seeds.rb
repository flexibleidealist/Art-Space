nicholas = Artist.create!(name: "Nicholas Rynearson", artist_statement: "I mainly work with found images. I often begin by asking, what simple intervention can I make in an image that will transform it? I like to work with formal qualities and my favorite interventions are forms of drawing or erasure. When I draw, I rarely use things like pens, pencils, or charcoal. Instead, I draw with a knife, with a thread and needle, or by creating lines and forms through juxtaposition. Erasure sometimes means cutting an element out of an image. But more often I prefer partial erasure: removing a portion of a particular element, drawing over it, or obscuring it from view. I like to use partial erasure to stimulate the viewers' imagination, inviting them to fill in gaps, to draw unexpected connections, or sometimes to see a ghost.
My formal training is in academia. In 2006 I finished my PhD in Classics, with a specialty in Greek literature. As an artist, Iâ€™m mostly self-taught but I have taken a few classes at SVA, including figure drawing and a collage workshop. I live in Brooklyn.", username: "Nicholas", password_digest: "1234567", image_url: "https://i.imgur.com/kHvKSSc.jpg")
